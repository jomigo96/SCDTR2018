# Calibration code

Code is modularized as:

+ `sketch_nov15a.ino` - main setup and loop.
+ `comms.h` - contains the communication protocols.
+ `controller.h` - contains a C++ class which wich will later be the controller
+ `calibration.h` - Contains the calibration function, which is called on setup.
