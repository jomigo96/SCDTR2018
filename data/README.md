# Things to evaluate

## Independant mode
+ Computation delays
+ Comunication times (serial)
+ Jitter
+ Flicker (change pwm)
+ Closed loop characteristics, dampning, overshoot, ....
+ Improvements with feed-forward only or feed-back only
+ Evaluate simulator accuracy
+ Anti-windup

## Cooperative mode
+ Communication times (I2C)
+ Compare controllers (independant vs distributed)
+ Performance metrics
